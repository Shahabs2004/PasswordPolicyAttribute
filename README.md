üîê Enhance Your C# Password Security with Custom Validation!

As developers, we‚Äôre responsible for building secure, user-friendly applications‚Äîespecially when it comes to handling sensitive information like passwords.
Weak password policies can lead to security vulnerabilities and expose users to potential attacks.
To address this, I‚Äôve recently created a PasswordPolicy attribute class in C# that provides a flexible, 
customizable way to enforce robust password security policies for any .NET Core MVC app.

Here‚Äôs what makes this class so effective:

Comprehensive Validation Rules:

Minimum/Maximum Length: Enforce length requirements for greater complexity.
Uppercase/Lowercase Letters: Require a mix of letter cases.
Special Characters and Digits: Ensure inclusion of symbols and numbers for strong password strength.
Exclusion of Specific Characters: Block specific characters, like / or \, to prevent SQL injections or other risks.
Consecutive or Sequential Characters: Disallow repeated or consecutive characters, preventing easy-to-guess patterns (e.g., 123456 or aaaa).
Common Dictionary Words: Rejects passwords with common, easily guessable words or patterns, like "password" or "123456".
User-Friendly Feedback: All failed validation rules are returned at once, with customizable separators for easy readability.
This approach enables users to see exactly what needs adjusting in their password.

Enhanced Security with Custom Rules: Security is enhanced by disallowing characters or patterns prone to injection attacks or predictable patterns, adding multiple layers of protection to your app‚Äôs authentication process.

Example Usage:
Simply apply the [PasswordPolicy] attribute to any password property in your DTO models. Here‚Äôs an example:
public class UserRequestDTO
{
    [PasswordPolicy(MinimumLength = 10, RequireUppercase = true, RequireSpecialChar = true, ExcludedChars = "/\"")]
    public string Password { get; set; }
}
